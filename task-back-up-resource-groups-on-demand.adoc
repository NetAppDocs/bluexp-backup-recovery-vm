. If the resource group has multiple policies configured, then in the Backup Now dialog box, select the policy you want to use for this backup operation.
. Click *OK* to start the backup.
. If the quiesce operation fails for any of the Virtual Machines in the backup, then the backup completes with a warning and is marked as not Virtual Machine consistent even if the selected policy has Virtual Machine consistency selected. In this case, it is possible that some of the Virtual Machines were successfully quiesced. In the job monitor, the failed Virtual Machine details will show the quiesce as failed.
