Known limitations identify functions that are not supported by this release of the product, or that do not interoperate correctly with it. Review these limitations carefully.

* BlueXP backup and recovery for VMs does not support Amazon FSx for ONTAPâ€™s automatic daily backups.
* The maximum limit of datastores that can be mounted are four. 
* In ONTAP 9.12.1 and below versions, BlueXP backup and recovery for VMs shows secondary location twice if snapshot locking is enabled. This issue is fixed in ONTAP 9.14.1RC1, ONTAP 9.13.1P4 - ONTAP 9.13.1P5, or ONTAP 9.12.1P8 - ONTAP 9.12.1P9.
